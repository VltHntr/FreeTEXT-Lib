# FreeTEXT-Lib

---

**A library for the FreeTEXT text editor.**

This library is intended to create the FreeTEXT Editor. But the library can also be used to work more easily with FreeTEXT formatting if you want to support FreeTEXT files in your programs.

Please note that the library is still in a very early stage and should therefore not be considered stable.

Documentation is not quite finished yet, but will be submitted as soon as possible.

Used library's:

* os
* json
* tkinter
* datetime
* dataclasses

*So basically you dont need to install external dependencies.*

> The development of the FreeTEXT Text Editor has not started yet due to the active development of the FreeTEXT-Lib library that the editor uses.
